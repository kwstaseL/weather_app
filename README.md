# Weather App ðŸŒ¦

### Overview 
A Simple, fully responsive weather application web-based tool that provides users with up-to-date weather information. 

It retrieves data from external APIs and displays a 5-day forecast, daily forecast, and current weather conditions. 

### Features

â€¢ __5-Day Forecast__: Users can view a detailed 5-day weather forecast, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for each day. To ensure accuracy and enhance the user experience, data analysis was performed to generate this forecast, as the API data lacked clarity or specificity.

â€¢ __Hourly Forecast__: Hourly forecast that provides users with real-time temperature and weather condition updates for every hour. 

â€¢ __Current Conditions__: The application displays real-time weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief description of the current weather.

â€¢ __Responsive Design__: The application is optimized for use on both desktop and mobile devices.
